# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The News2Docx project has grown to over 4,000 lines of code across 19 Python modules with a complex layered architecture. While functional, the codebase has become bloated with excessive abstraction layers, redundant utilities, and over-engineered patterns that make maintenance difficult. This refactoring aims to simplify the architecture while preserving all core functionality.

## Glossary

- **News2Docx_System**: The complete news scraping, processing, and export application
- **Core_Pipeline**: The three-stage workflow of scrape → process → export
- **TUI_Interface**: The Rich-based terminal user interface
- **AI_Processing**: The two-stage content cleaning and translation using SiliconFlow API
- **DOCX_Export**: The Word document generation functionality
- **Configuration_System**: The YAML-based configuration management

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining News2Docx, I want a simplified codebase structure, so that I can easily understand and modify the application without navigating through excessive abstraction layers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE News2Docx_System SHALL consolidate the current 9 package directories into a maximum of 4 logical modules
2. THE News2Docx_System SHALL reduce the total lines of code by at least 30% while maintaining all existing functionality
3. THE News2Docx_System SHALL eliminate redundant utility functions and duplicate configuration handling
4. THE News2Docx_System SHALL maintain the single entry point via `python index.py`
5. THE News2Docx_System SHALL preserve all existing configuration options and file formats

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of News2Docx, I want the same functionality and performance, so that the refactoring does not impact my workflow or output quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE News2Docx_System SHALL maintain identical scraping capabilities from GDELT API
2. THE News2Docx_System SHALL preserve the two-stage AI processing pipeline (cleaning → translation)
3. THE News2Docx_System SHALL generate DOCX files with identical formatting and content structure
4. THE News2Docx_System SHALL support all current export options (split/merged, bilingual/monolingual)
5. THE News2Docx_System SHALL maintain the Rich TUI interface with all existing features

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want cleaner separation of concerns, so that each module has a single, well-defined responsibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE News2Docx_System SHALL separate core business logic from infrastructure concerns
2. THE News2Docx_System SHALL eliminate circular dependencies between modules
3. THE News2Docx_System SHALL consolidate all configuration handling into a single module
4. THE News2Docx_System SHALL remove the services layer abstraction that duplicates core functionality
5. THE News2Docx_System SHALL simplify the data model classes to essential fields only

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved code maintainability, so that future enhancements are easier to implement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE News2Docx_System SHALL reduce the number of import statements by consolidating related functionality
2. THE News2Docx_System SHALL eliminate dead code and unused utility functions
3. THE News2Docx_System SHALL simplify error handling by removing redundant try-catch blocks
4. THE News2Docx_System SHALL consolidate logging configuration into a single initialization point
5. THE News2Docx_System SHALL maintain all existing development tools (ruff, black, pytest) compatibility

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want preserved external interfaces, so that existing configuration files and user workflows remain unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE News2Docx_System SHALL maintain compatibility with existing `config.yml` files
2. THE News2Docx_System SHALL preserve all command-line behavior and TUI interactions
3. THE News2Docx_System SHALL maintain the same output directory structure and file naming
4. THE News2Docx_System SHALL keep all existing environment variable support
5. THE News2Docx_System SHALL preserve the caching mechanisms and run directory management
