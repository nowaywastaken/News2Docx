The vote, which occurred just hours before a midnight deadline, fell short of the 60-vote threshold required to pass the measure. The bill, which had already cleared the House of Representatives earlier this month, faced staunch opposition from Democrats, who blocked its advancement. The failure to secure the necessary votes highlighted the deepening partisan divide over funding levels and the broader political tensions surrounding the issue. With the deadline approaching, the Senate’s inability to reach a compromise left the federal government in limbo, risking partial closures of non-essential services. The rejection underscored the challenges of navigating a divided Congress, where procedural hurdles and ideological differences often stall critical legislation.%%\nIn a separate attempt to address the funding impasse, the Senate also failed to pass a Democratic proposal that would have extended federal spending through October 31. This bill included provisions to maintain expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and reverse certain health program cuts implemented by Republicans earlier in the year. The Democratic plan aimed to stabilize the government’s operations while also addressing long-standing concerns about healthcare access and Medicaid funding. However, it too was blocked by Republicans, who argued that the measure would increase the deficit and delay necessary fiscal reforms. The repeated failures to pass either bill reflected the Senate’s inability to bridge the gap between the two parties, leaving the government’s financial status unresolved. The situation also raised questions about the effectiveness of congressional negotiations in the face of escalating political polarization.%%\nSenators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, who are independents but caucus with the Democrats, played a pivotal role in the voting dynamics. Their support was crucial in the Democratic effort to pass the funding extension, but their absence from the Republican side meant the bill lacked the necessary bipartisan backing. The shutdown threat has become a recurring feature of the current political climate, with both parties leveraging it as a tool to push their agendas. While the immediate consequence of the stalemate is the potential disruption of government services, the broader implications include economic uncertainty, strained public institutions, and a loss of public trust in congressional governance. As the deadline looms, the situation may force lawmakers to revisit the issue in the coming days, though the path to resolution remains unclear. The failure to act underscores the fragility of legislative cooperation in a deeply divided Congress, where even routine functions are politicized.", "adjusted_word_count": 434, "translated_content": "参议院几乎未能阻止政府停摆，因为它否决了一项共和党提出的法案，该法案旨在将联邦资金维持在当前水平直至11月21日。这场投票发生在午夜截止时间前数小时，未能达到通过该措施所需的60票门槛。该法案此前已于本月早些时候通过众议院，但遭到民主党人的强烈反对，他们阻止了其推进。未能获得必要票数凸显了围绕资金水平日益加剧的党派分歧，以及该问题所引发的更广泛政治紧张局势。随着截止日期临近，参议院无法达成妥协，使联邦政府陷入僵局，可能引发非必要服务的部分关闭。该否决也凸显了在分裂的国会中推进立法的困难，其中程序障碍和意识形态差异常导致关键立法停滞。%%\n为应对资金僵局，参议院还未能通过一项民主党提案，该提案将联邦支出延长至10月31日。该法案包含维持《平价医疗法案》（奥巴马医改）下即将到期补贴的条款，并撤销共和党今年早些时候实施的某些健康项目削减。民主党计划旨在稳定政府运作，同时解决长期存在的医疗保障获取和医疗补助资金问题。然而，该提案同样遭到共和党人的阻挠，他们认为这将增加赤字并推迟必要的财政改革。双方未能通过任何一项法案反映了参议院弥合两党分歧的无力，使政府财政状况仍未解决。这一情况也引发了对国会谈判在政治极化加剧背景下是否有效的质疑。%%\n佛蒙特州的伯尼·桑德斯和缅因州的安格斯·金两位独立参议员，尽管他们与民主党结盟，但在投票动态中发挥了关键作用。他们的支持对民主党通过资金延期至关重要，但他们在共和党阵营的缺席意味着该法案缺乏必要的跨党派支持。政府停摆威胁已成为当前政治气候中的常态，两党均将其作为推动各自议程的工具。尽管立即后果是政府服务可能中断，但更广泛的影响包括经济不确定性、公共机构压力增大以及公众对国会治理的信任流失。随着截止日期临近，这一情况可能迫使议员们在接下来几天内重新审视该问题，但解决路径仍不明确。未能采取行动凸显了在高度分裂的国会中立法合作的脆弱性，其中即使是常规职能也受到政治化的影响。", "target_language": "Chinese", "processing_timestamp": "20251001_230026", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/09/30/us/senate-shutdown-vote.html", "success": true}, "metrics": {"elapsed": 145.54547834396362}}

However, the city has maintained secrecy around the details, claiming public disclosure could harm Indigenous interests. Critics, including OneBC MLA Dallas Brodie, argue this opacity reflects a deeper issue in British Columbia’s reconciliation efforts: a tendency to prioritize symbolic gestures over transparency. The controversy surfaced when Brodie shared a budget breakdown for Musqueam’s involvement in the project, obtained through B.C.’s freedom-of-information process. This revelation exposed the city’s financial allocation, sparking debates about whether reconciliation initiatives should be shielded from public scrutiny or held accountable for their costs.%%\nThe disclosed budget revealed $10,000 for planning the renaming event in 2022, $6,000 for 10 consultation meetings, $7,500 for collaborative work on street sign design, pronunciation guides, and the “renaming story,” and $10,000 for a launch party featuring a bouncy castle, dunk tank, and train ride. Brodie, who later withdrew her public disclosure, criticized the spending as wasteful, particularly given Vancouver’s recent property tax hikes—10.7% in 2023, 7.5% in 2024, and a planned 7% increase for 2025. She argued that the city’s focus on “feel-good” reconciliation efforts diverts resources from critical public needs, such as maintaining clean and safe spaces. This critique highlights a growing tension between symbolic actions and fiscal responsibility, as critics question whether such gestures address systemic inequities or merely serve political optics.%%\nThe renaming also ignited debates about historical erasure. Joseph Trutch, B.C.’s first lieutenant-governor, was a colonial figure whose policies contributed to the displacement of Indigenous communities. Brodie emphasized the importance of acknowledging such figures, warning that erasing them risks disconnecting communities from their history. Meanwhile, the Squamish Nation opposed the change, noting the street passes through their ancestral village. These disputes underscore the complexity of integrating Indigenous heritage into urban spaces, with some viewing the renaming as a step toward cultural recognition and others as an act of disrespect. The conflict reveals differing perspectives on how to honor Indigenous history without perpetuating colonial narratives.%%\nVancouver’s secrecy extends beyond this single initiative, raising broader concerns about accountability. Brodie argued that withholding details about reconciliation projects undermines democratic principles, as transparency is essential for public oversight. She suggested that if officials seek to avoid scrutiny, such efforts should be funded privately. However, B.C.’s reconciliation gag law, which restricts disclosure of Indigenous-related initiatives, has become a tool to obscure spending and decision-making. Similar provisions exist in federal legislation, such as the Impact Assessment Act, which shields “Indigenous knowledge” from public inquiry, even when it impacts project approvals. These laws, critics claim, prioritize reconciliation narratives over public accountability.%%\nThe controversy over šxʷməθkʷəy̓əmasəm Street reflects a larger struggle: can reconciliation succeed in a system that hides its costs and decisions? Brodie warned that secrecy risks perpetuating inequities and eroding trust, as it prevents meaningful public dialogue about how resources are allocated. She remains prepared to challenge the law, calling it a “toxic breed of rule” that puts the public last. The debate hinges on whether cultural recognition can coexist with openness and fairness in civic governance, or if such efforts will continue to be undermined by a lack of transparency. The answer, ultimately, depends on whether reconciliation is seen as a process of healing or a political maneuver shielded from accountability.", "adjusted_word_count": 581, "translated_content": "温哥华将特鲁奇街更名为šxʷməθkʷəy̓əmasəm，即穆斯克默姆原住民的传统名称，计划向该部落支付33,500加元。然而，市政府对相关细节保持保密，声称公开披露可能损害原住民利益。批评者，包括不列颠哥伦比亚省议员达拉斯·布罗迪，认为这种不透明反映了不列颠哥伦比亚省和解进程中的更深层次问题：倾向于将象征性举措置于透明度之上。争议爆发时，布罗迪分享了穆斯克默姆参与该项目的预算明细，该明细是通过不列颠哥伦比亚省的信息自由法程序获得的。这一披露暴露了市政府的财政分配，引发了关于和解举措是否应免于公众监督或是否应对其成本负责的讨论。%%\n披露的预算显示，2022年重命名活动的筹备费用为10,000加元，10次咨询会议费用为6,000加元，7,500加元用于街牌设计、发音指南和“重命名故事”的协作工作，以及10,000加元用于包含充气城堡、沉浸水池和火车之旅的启幕活动。布罗迪后来撤回了公开披露，批评这些支出浪费，尤其是在温哥华最近的房产税上涨背景下——2023年上涨10.7%，2024年上涨7.5%，2025年计划再上涨7%。她认为，市政府对“感觉良好的”和解努力的专注，使资源从诸如维护清洁和安全空间等关键公共需求中转移。这一批评突显了象征性行动与财政责任之间日益加剧的紧张关系，因为批评者质疑这些举措是否解决系统性不平等，还是仅仅服务于政治噱头。%%\n重命名也引发了关于历史抹除的讨论。不列颠哥伦比亚省首位副督约瑟夫·特鲁奇是殖民者，其政策导致了原住民社区的流离失所。布罗迪强调承认此类人物的重要性，警告抹除他们可能使社区与自身历史脱节。与此同时，斯夸米什民族反对这一更改，指出该街道穿过其祖先村落。这些分歧凸显了将原住民遗产融入城市空间的复杂性，一些人认为重命名是文化认同的一步，另一些人则认为这是对原住民的不尊重。冲突揭示了在尊重原住民历史的同时避免延续殖民叙事的不同观点。%%\n温哥华的保密不仅限于这一单一举措，引发了更广泛的问责问题。布罗迪认为，隐瞒和解项目的细节会削弱民主原则，因为透明度是公众监督的关键。她建议，如果官员希望避免审查，这些努力应由私人资助。然而，不列颠哥伦比亚省的和解沉默法，限制了与原住民相关项目的披露，已成为掩盖支出和决策的工具。联邦立法中也有类似条款，例如影响评估法案，该法案将“原住民知识”从公众调查中隔离，即使这些知识影响项目审批。批评者称，这些法律优先考虑和解叙事而非公众问责。%%\n关于šxʷməθkʷəy̓əmasəm街的争议反映了更大的斗争：和解能否在一个隐藏其成本和决策的体系中成功？布罗迪警告说，保密可能加剧不平等并削弱信任，因为它阻碍了公众对资源分配进行有意义的讨论。她准备挑战该法律，称其为“一种有害的规则类型”，将公众置于最后。这场辩论的关键在于文化认同能否与市政治理中的开放和公平共存，或者这些努力是否会继续因缺乏透明度而受到削弱。最终，答案取决于人们是否将和解视为治愈的过程，还是视为免于问责的政治手段。", "target_language": "Chinese", "processing_timestamp": "20251001_230235", "url": "https://nationalpost.com/opinion/jamie-sarkonak-reconciliation-gag-laws-have-no-place-in-a-democracy", "success": true}, "metrics": {"elapsed": 273.9989581108093}}

The annual event, which celebrates the final feeding frenzy of bears at Brooks River in Katmai National Park and Preserve, ended in a dramatic showdown. Chunk, who had previously been named runner-up for two consecutive years, finally secured the title after a fierce battle. This year’s winner received 96,350 votes, outpacing Chunk’s tally by 32,625. Park officials and Explore.org, the organization behind the event, announced the results on Tuesday, highlighting Chunk’s resilience as a key factor in his win.%%\nFat Bear Week, held from late August to early September, is a cherished tradition that follows the bears’ summer feeding season. As the animals prepare for hibernation, their weight gain becomes a focal point for wildlife enthusiasts and global viewers. Chunk, one of the largest bears in the Brooks River area, has long been a fan favorite due to his commanding presence and consistent performance. His weight, estimated at over 1,200 pounds, reflects his dominance over the river’s salmon bounty. However, this year’s competition took an unexpected turn when Chunk returned to the river in June with a severe jaw injury, likely sustained during a territorial clash with another male bear during mating season.%%\nPark rangers initially feared Chunk’s ability to compete effectively. A broken jaw would hinder his capacity to catch and consume salmon, a vital food source. Yet, Chunk’s determination shone through. He adapted swiftly, using alternative techniques to eat without relying on his full mandible. His ingenuity enabled him to retain his top feeder status, even as his injury lingered. “Chunk used his determination and adaptability to persevere through injury,” the park noted in his profile. “His broken jaw is a permanent condition that will not heal.”%%\nChunk’s victory underscores both his physical might and mental resilience. His ability to overcome the injury has captivated voters, who celebrated his grit and survival skills. The win also highlights the unpredictable nature of wildlife, where challenges like injuries or competition can shape an animal’s fate. For park officials, Chunk’s triumph serves as a reminder of the resilience required to thrive in Katmai’s competitive ecosystem.%%\nChunk’s win has cemented his reputation as the king of the fat bears, both in public perception and park records. His story exemplifies the blend of strength, strategy, and perseverance needed to succeed in the wild. As the season continues, his adaptability will be vital for surviving another winter. For now, Chunk’s win is a testament to survival and a symbol of the enduring public fascination with these powerful creatures.%%\nKiki Intarasuwan is a news editor for CBS News & Stations.  \n© 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.
